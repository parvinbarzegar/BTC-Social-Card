## I have used the following libraries:
    Ant Design: desiging the user interface,
    Axios: loading data from API,
    Toatify: showing notifications to users,
    Validator: checking user inputs format.

- I have also added a Pagination with 5 user profiles in each page.
- The LOAD DATA button loads the data from the API.
- There is a label to show the total number of users in the page.
- All users will be stored at local storage as the assignement says there is no need to use Back-end. Therefore, new users will be stored in local storage. Updating a user will afect its object stored at local storage (our updates will not change the remote data as it is a Fake API).
